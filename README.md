Welcome to the Mass Calibration for MP and EMD Analysis Project
The goal of this project is to create tools to analyse raw fitres objects, fit a mixture of Gaussians (GMM) to events, and compute metrics such as sigma, skew and mean for individual event tables, as well as EMD and EMD-based metrics for event table-event table comparison
